# PacManQT
+ This Pacman game was made using QT framework. Everything was handled using only QT API and no external libraries were used in this project.
+ This was a team project with three members.
  ++ Seif Sallam - me (Project Leader)
  ++ Mohamed A. Khalil
  ++ Sara Abdel Halim
+ This was a class project for the course Fundementals of Computing II in the American University in Cairo (AUC).
## Visuals
+ All the assets were found from google with open source images with no lisance.
+ Some of the tiles were modified using Gimp to make them ecstatically pleasing and more fitting the game.

## Data Structures
+ Graphs were deployed effectively in this project.

## Algorithms
+ Dijkstra's Algorithm for path finding was used to determine the movement of the ghosts.
+ The three ghosts have different intelligence levels. 
  ++ One is intelligent (Runs the algorithm every frame)
  ++ Another is "dumb" (Runs the algorithm every 10 frames)
  ++ The third is random (Randomly chooses its next move every frame)
